        <p> <h4>&nbsp; The requirements for this week's assginment was to make and document either a kinetic sculpture or a quick prototype of a possible final project.

      <h4> <p>&nbsp; At the beginning, my idea was to create a led-fan that creates some patterns when the fan rotates. However, I found out that I didn't have the materials to do that, and it took few days for cardboards and hot glues to arrive. So I only had few hours of time to make a simpler version. </p>

        <p>&nbsp; Here is a diagram to illustrate the circuit.</p>

        <p><h4>Since I don't know the exact value of resistance for each led, I decided to do this circuit again with two different resistor. </p>

        <p><h4>&nbsp;For the last part of the assignment, I played with the potentiometer, and visualised the value readed using the code below.
