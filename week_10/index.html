        <p> <h4>&nbsp; This week, we are working with stepper motors. This is very important for my final project, which is a remote camera stand. So it is a good chance to first try the motors out with the laser-cutted wodden pieces. But for this assignment, I am just gonna design this for my phone.
<br/>&nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
     <p>&nbsp; The first thing to do is assemble the all the parts together. But before that, since my bearings have those plastic inner rings, I had to use hair dryer to heat the bearings, so they got softened and could be take out. </p>

       &nbsp; <img src="../images/heatbearings.jpg" class="img-responsive margin" style="width:80%" alt="week1_html">

        <p>&nbsp; Then, in order to achieve the effect that I want , which is having two stepper motors working together to adjust the camera, I printed out these two objects, one is for holding the motor, and the other one is for connecting the second stepper motor to the phone. Then I measured the dimensions of motor and my phone using caliper, making sure the printed objects would fit them in. </p>

        <p><h4>Then, I printed them out. However, the products weren't really successful, The phone-holder broke when I tried to remove the supporting materials. </p>

        <p><h4>&nbsp;Anyway, I hot-glued the parts together for now, and running the single stepper motor to acchieve the sliding effect, and recorded a short clip.</p> 
  
  
       <p> <h4>&nbsp;Here is the clip. </p>
